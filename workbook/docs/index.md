- [ ] [Exercise 2](exercises/exercise2.md): Set up appropriate logging for monitoring our cloud resources
- [ ] [Exercise 3](exercises/exercise3.md): Attack our infrastructure to create a true-positive match to our detection technique
- [ ] [Exercise 4](exercises/exercise4.md): Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to built a query to catch the true-positive and create an analytics rule with automation 
- [ ] [Exercise 5](exercises/exercise5.md): Test the detection and automation (with a bonus response action)
- [ ] [Exercise 6](exercises/exercise6.md): Cleanup of the workshop resources
